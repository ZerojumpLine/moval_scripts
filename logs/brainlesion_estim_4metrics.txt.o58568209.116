Starting optimizing for model ts-model with confidence energy-conf based on metric auc, class specific is True.
Opitimizing with 9 samples...
Be patient, it should take a while...
Not satisfied with initial optimization results of param for class 1, trying more initial states...
Tried 1/2 times.
Tried 2/2 times.
